# CoffeeWorld

CoffeeWorld is a decentralized coffee shop discovery platform designed to deliver authentic reviews and real-time crowd insightsâ€”powered by Worldcoinâ€™s WorldID verification.

## Overview

When searching for a cozy coffee shop, itâ€™s often hard to tell which reviews are genuine. Many platforms are flooded with paid or fake comments that donâ€™t reflect the actual experience. CoffeeWorld solves this problem by ensuring every review comes from a verified human using WorldID. In addition, our check-in feature provides real-time data on how crowded each coffee shop is, giving you a true picture of your surroundings.

## Features

- WorldID Verified Reviews:
Every review is linked to a unique, verified user, ensuring authenticity and trustworthiness.
- Real-Time Check-Ins:
Users can check in at their favorite coffee shops to update current occupancy. Color codes indicate crowd levels:
- ðŸŸ¢ Relaxed (few people)
- ðŸŸ¡ Moderate (some seating)
- ðŸ”´ Crowded (likely to have a wait)
- Incentives for Engagement:
Businesses can reward reviews that receive significant community support, encouraging honest feedback and building a trusted community.

## How It Works

1. User Verification:
Using Worldcoinâ€™s MiniKit, users verify their identity with WorldID before they can post a review or check in. This prevents fake reviews and ensures every interaction is backed by a real, unique human.
2. Review & Check-In System:
- Reviews: Verified users post reviews about the coffee shopâ€™s products, environment, and service.
- Check-Ins: Users can check in to provide real-time data on the current crowd. This information is aggregated and color-coded for easy visualization.
3. Backend Verification:
The verification proof (including details like proof, merkle_root, and nullifier_hash) is sent to our backend for further validation, ensuring the integrity of every review.

## Technology Stack

- Frontend:
  - Next.js with TypeScript for a modern, scalable web application.
  - Tailwind CSS for rapid and responsive UI development.
- Backend:
  - Next.js API routes for handling secure server-side operations, such as verifying WorldID proofs and managing reviews.
- Third-Party Integrations:
  - Worldcoin MiniKit for identity verification.
  - Google Maps API for displaying nearby coffee shops (with our own custom review and check-in data).
